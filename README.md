Capstone Project: Personal Finance Tracker
  This program allows the user to track their expenses.

Users can use the program by running the finance_tracker.py file.
Once running, the program will give the user four options to choose from:
  1. Add Expense
  2. View All Expenses
  3. View Summary
  4. Exit

Users can pick an option by inputing a corresponding number (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4)
1. Add Expense
   When adding an expense, the program will prompt the user to enter a description, category, and amount for the expense.
   The program ensures the description and category aren't empty and that the amount is a valid number.
   If the expense information is valid, it will be stored in a dictionary and each expense is sorted by category.
2. View All Expenses
   Displays all expenses stored in the dictionary, listing the expenses under their respective categories.
3. View Summary
   Displays the total expense for each category by summing up the cost of each entry under a specific category.
4. Exit
   Exits the progam when selected by the user.
